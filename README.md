# Youtube_Transcript_Translator

Description:
A python application, made with Kivy, that that takes a Youtube link as input, uses the Youtube_Transcript API to get the transcript of a video.
It then uses a Translation API to translate the transcript of a video in romanian and display it on screen at the same pace as Youtube.
(Currently Slow and can't Pause)

How to use:
1. Copy the Youtube link by pressing the SHARE button and then COPY.
2. Run the app and paste the link.
3. Press the "Start!" button and wait for it to finish (it will take a while).
4. Press the new "Start" button to begin Transcribing.
